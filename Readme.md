# filemanager

This prestashop module is a file management module for PrestaShop, allowing administrators to upload, manage, and organize files. And the best thing is that you can copy the path of your uploaded file and use it easily in your other modules like slider or blog.

The module was made in a rush to fill a quick need, so its pretty ugly, I plan to make the code cleaner and the user experiance more dynamic in the future, please feel free to offer your support !
